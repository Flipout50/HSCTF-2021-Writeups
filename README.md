# HSCTF-2021-Writeups
These are writeups for my completed challenges at HSCTF 2021! As part of the team BASHing_thru_challenges, I focused on Algorithms and Web but also completed challenges in RE, Misc, and Crypto.

Completing these challenges was a ton of fun and I hope you learn something from their solutions.
